# To_Do-List
The To-Do List Web App is a simple yet functional task manager built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks by adding new items, marking them as complete, and removing them when no longer needed. Designed with a clean and responsive layout, the app offers a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

The core of the application lies in its interactivity, handled entirely by vanilla JavaScript. Tasks are dynamically created and appended to the list as the user inputs them. Users can toggle the completion state of each task, often displayed using a strikethrough effect, and delete tasks with a single click. All actions happen instantly on the page without the need for reloading.

Styling is managed through CSS, ensuring that the interface is visually appealing and user-friendly. The layout is responsive and adapts well to various screen sizes, making it accessible from phones, tablets, and desktops alike.

To use the app, you simply open the index.html file in a web browser. There's no need for a server or database â€” everything runs in the browser. For developers, it's a great starting point to practice DOM manipulation and build on with features like task persistence using local storage, task categorization.
